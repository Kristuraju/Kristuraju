<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
 Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" 
(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual
 outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.
 Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. 
  
<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of badminton developed in
 the mid-19th century among the British as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
 ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".)[4] Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's 
Badminton House in Gloucestershire,[5] but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published
 a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived.[6] An 1863 article in The Cornhill 
Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".[7]

The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India,[8] where it was very popular by the 1870s.
[6] Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early
 as the 1850s[9] and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

<h2>STRATEGY</h2>
<p><h4>Singles</h4>
Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible;
 this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court.</p>

<p><h4>Doubles</h4>
Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. 
Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court,
 and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift.</p>
